# How Long Was He Walking?

### Puzzle 

* Every day, Jack arrives at the station from work at 5 PM.
* His wife, Jennifer, leaves from home in her car to meet him at the station at exactly 5 PM and drives him home.
* One day, Jack arrives at the station 1 hour earlier than usual, and starts walking home.
* His wife meets him on the road, picks him up, and drives him home.
* On that day, they arrive at home 30 minutes earlier than usual.
* How long was Jack walking? 

### Solution

* The best way to think about this problem is to consider it from the perspective of Jennifer.
* Jennifer's round-trip time was reduced by 30 minutes.
* That means her driving-time to the station and back from the station were both reduced by 15 minutes.
* Jack must have been walking for a total of 45 minutes.
* For example, if Jennifer's usual departure time is 4:30 PM, she meets Jack at the station at 5:00 PM, and they both arrive back home at 5:30 PM. On the day Jack arrives at 4:00 PM, they both arrive back home at 5:00 PM. Assuming that Jennifer's departure time is the same (4:30 PM), Jennifer must meet Jack at 4:45 PM in order for them to return home by 5:00 PM. That means Jack must have been walking for 45 minutes (4:00 PM to 4:45 PM).
