### Role Playing

* Listen to and practice dialog (do not be afraid to write your own dialog)
* You need to give your student a framework with conversation prompts
* Before you actually start roleplaying, give your student a few minutes to read through the script
* You don't need a script necessarily, you can give your student a prompt and they are responsible for filling out that prompt with dialogue
* When you are doing role play with your student, make sure to repeat, repeat, repeat
* Ultimately, the goal of roleplay is to do it without too much thinking, because that is what they have to do in the real world anyway
