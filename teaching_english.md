### Practicing Speaking Skills: Role Playing

* Listen to and practice dialog (do not be afraid to write your own dialog)
* You need to give your student a framework with conversation prompts
* Before you actually start roleplaying, give your student a few minutes to read through the script
* You don't need a script necessarily, you can give your student a prompt and they are responsible for filling out that prompt with dialogue
* When you are doing role play with your student, make sure to repeat, repeat, repeat
* Ultimately, the goal of roleplay is to do it without too much thinking, because that is what they have to do in the real world anyway

### Practicing Listening Skills

* When practicing with a student on their listening skills, you need to be careful of words blending together 
* Strong accents can also be difficult to understand
* Just listening to your voice (and your accent) will not be sufficient for a well-rounded listening education
* You will need to provide listening samples with different accents, content, and styles of speaking
* You should discuss the topic in the listening activity before you actually play the audio file 
* You need to give your student a reason for listening, you need to give them something to listen *for*
* There `listening for general information` (this should generally be done first in a listening exercise)
* There is also `listening for detailed information` (this can be done on a second pass of the listening exercise)
* Generally, listening for details is much more challenging for the learner

### Phases of a Listening Exercise

* (1.) First, discuss the topic
* (2.) Then, have the student listen for general information
* (3.) Finally, have the student listen for detailed information
* If your student is struggling, try giving them a transcript of the recording
